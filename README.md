# Insertion-Sort-Project
 Basic insertion sort examples
## First Project of the Data Structures and Algorithms Section from Patika.dev
## [22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort
## Task 1 - Write the stages of the above sequence according to the sort type
[22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]
[2, 27, 16, 22, 18, 6]
[2, 6, 16, 22, 18, 27]
[2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]


## Task 2 - Write the Big-O notation
 * O(n^2)
## Task 3: What is the complexity of 18 after the list is sorted?
* Average Case
## Write the first 4 steps of insertion sort for list [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]
* [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
* [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]
* [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
* [2,3,4,5,6,9,8,15,7]
